Thank you for creating the page. However, there has been a critical misunderstanding that we need to fix immediately.
'Single Toggle Jaw Crusher' and 'Double Toggle Jaw Crusher' are two separate, distinct products. They must each have their own individual product page. Combining them onto a single page with a short table is incorrect and confuses the customer.
Our goal is to have two unique URLs:
 * /products/double-toggle-jaw-crusher (showing a detailed table with many models)
 * /products/single-toggle-jaw-crusher (showing a simpler summary table)
The problem is in your data model. Your immediate task is to correct this.
Your Task: Correct the Product Data and Verify the Pages
Step 1: Correct the Product Data Model (/data/products.ts)
Go to your data/products.ts file.
 * Delete any existing, combined "Jaw Crusher" object.
 * Add the following two NEW, SEPARATE product objects to your products array. I am providing the exact data you need to use. This data includes the detailed multi-model table for the "Double Toggle" crusher that you must use.

  ]
}

Step 2: Verify the Frontend Pages
Your existing dynamic page at app/products/[slug]/page.tsx should now work correctly with this new data. You do not need to change the code on that page.
Action: Please verify the following:
 * Navigating to /products/double-toggle-jaw-crusher must display the page for the "Double Toggle" crusher with the large, detailed multi-model specification table.
 * Navigating to /products/single-toggle-jaw-crusher must display the page for the "Single Toggle" crusher with the smaller, simpler key-value specification table.
Step 3: Update Homepage Links
Finally, ensure that if you are featuring a jaw crusher on the homepage, the link points to the correct, specific URL (e.g., /products/double-toggle-jaw-crusher), not a generic one.
Your Deliverable:
Please confirm that you have updated the data model as instructed and that both jaw crusher pages are now displaying correctly and separately.
