 * Structured Data: We add the new FAQs to our central data file (products.ts) in a structured way.
 * Intelligent API: Our backend API (/api/products/[slug]) will be updated. When a product page is requested, the API will not only provide the product data but also bundle the corresponding FAQs into a special format that Google and AI models are specifically designed to read.
 * Enhanced Visibility: This special format (called JSON-LD) tells the AI, "This page contains a product, AND here is a list of common questions and their official answers about it." This makes it highly likely that your answers will be featured directly in search results and used by AI chats, positioning you as the definitive expert.
This approach integrates perfectly with the advanced backend we have already built.
Prompt for Replit Agent: Implement & Optimize FAQs
To Replit Agent:
We will now add the new, high-value FAQ sections to our product pages and ensure they are optimized for AI discoverability. This is a three-part task: update the data source, enhance the backend API, and render the FAQs on the frontend.
Step 1: Update the Product Data File
 * Action: Go to the data file at /src/data/products.ts.
 * 1. Update the Product Interface: Add a new optional property for our FAQs.
   export interface Product {
  // ...all existing properties
  faqs?: { question: string; answer: string }[];
}

 * 2. Add the FAQ Content: For each of the product objects listed below, add the new faqs array inside the object.

 Double-Toggle Jaw Crusher

             1. Is the higher initial cost of a Double Toggle worth it?
                  Yes, for abrasive rock like granite, its reduced wear on jaw plates delivers a significantly lower total cost of ownership.
	2.	What capacity and feed size can I expect?
	•	The VTST handles feed up to 725 mm and crushes 25–300 tph (tons per hour), depending on setting and material hardness.

	3.	How easy is routine maintenance?
	•	Grease points are externally located and accessible; jaw-plate change-outs take under 2 hours with standard tools.
	

FAQs for: HSI (Horizontal Shaft Impactor)
 * 1. When should I choose an HSI over a Jaw Crusher?
   > Choose an HSI for less abrasive material like limestone or when you require a superior cubical product shape in a single pass

2.	How do I extend wear part life?
	•	Use the correct alloy blow bars for your material (hard vs. soft), maintain proper feed distribution, and inspect liners every 300 hours for rotation and rebalance.
	3.	Can it handle recycled concrete and asphalt?
	•	Yes, our impact crusher is optimized for “clean” demolition debris, producing high-quality aggregates with minimal fines when operated at recommended RPMs.


VTIS Vibrating Screen
	1.	Which screen media options do you offer?
	•	Choose woven wire, polyurethane or punch-plate decks in 10–100 mm apertures to suit scalping, sizing or dewatering.

2. How difficult is it to change the screen media (mesh or panels)?
   > Screen media changes are straightforward. Our design features side-tensioning rails that provide easy access and allow for quick replacement to minimize downtime.

3.	What materials can I sort with it?
Sand, gravel, crushed stone—even recycled concrete—you name it. Choose the right mesh size, and you’ll separate fines, mids, and overs in one pass.

	4.	Will it handle clay and dirt?
Yes—an optional spray-bar system keeps the mesh clear, so even damp or slightly sticky material passes cleanly.

 

FAQs for: Hydrocyclone Sand Classifiers
 * 1. What is the primary advantage of a Hydrocyclone over a traditional screw classifier?
   > A Hydrocyclone offers much finer and more precise particle separation, making it ideal for recovering fine sand and removing silt with higher efficiency.
   > 
 * 2. Does this system require a lot of water to operate effectively?
   > While it uses water, the system is designed to be highly efficient. It works in a closed circuit with the dewatering screen, which recovers a majority of the water for immediate reuse.
   
 * 3. How does the dewatering screen ensure the final sand product is not too wet?
   > The high-frequency vibrations of the screen separate the water from the sand


VTSS Single-Toggle Jaw Crusher
	1.	How easy is it to change the output size?
You can quickly adjust the crusher’s gap in minutes using the built-in hydraulic or manual toggle
		2.	Can I integrate this crusher into my existing plant?
Absolutely, its modular mounting feet and help of our experts make retrofit seamless.
	3.	Can it handle hard rock?
Yes, the VTSS handles most stone types (granite, limestone, basalt), crushing up to 500 tph without trouble.



FAQs for: Screw Sand Washers
 * 1. What is the primary job of a Screw Sand Washer?
   > It efficiently scrubs, washes, and dewaters sand to remove unwanted clay, silt, and other fine impurities.
   > 
 * 2. How does this machine prevent the loss of valuable fine sand?
   > The long screw and upward flow of water create a calm settling pool that allows fine sand to be retained while washing away lighter contaminants.
   > 
 * 3. What is the difference between a single screw and a double screw model?
   > A double screw model can process a much higher volume of material in the same footprint, making it ideal for large-scale operations.
   > 


Mobile Crushing Plant
	1.	How quickly can it move between jobs?
Fully self-contained on tracks or wheels, it can roll onto the next site and be up and running in under an hour.

2. How quickly can a mobile plant be set up and begin operation on-site?
   > Our pre-integrated mobile units are designed for rapid deployment and can typically be commissioned and operational within a few hours of arriving at your site.

Yes. Modular designs let you combine jaw, cone, HSI, VSI, and screens in any order—just bolt the modules together.




Vibrating Feeders 
	1.	What materials can I feed with a combined grizzly and pan feeder?
From large rocks and aggregates to fine sand, the grizzly removes oversize while the pan feeder meters the rest for even processing.
	2.	How do I adjust feed rate and separation size?
Simple stroke and amplitude controls let you dial in exactly how much material passes and what size bypasses the grizzly.
	3.	Can this handle abrasive ores and wet clay?
Yes, rugged liners and optional spray bars keep both grizzly bars and the pan surface clear in tough, sticky conditions.

Conveyor Systems

* 1. Do you provide standard-sized conveyors or custom-engineered solutions?
   > We specialize in designing and manufacturing custom conveyor systems tailored to the specific layout, material, and throughput requirements of your quarry or plant.

	2.	What conveyor layout is best for my quarry?
We’ll design everything from fixed overland belts to mobile radial conveyors to fit your pit geometry and material flow.
	3.	How do I integrate custom conveyor solutions with existing plant equipment?
Modular frames and standard drives let you bolt new conveyor runs onto feeders, crushers, screens or stockpiles with minimal welding

4. Can you design a complete plant-wide conveyor network?
   > Absolutely; we can engineer a fully integrated network to efficiently transfer material between every stage of your circuit, from the primary crusher to the final stockpiles.
Step 2: Update the Backend API Transformer
 * Action: Go to the AI-First API endpoint at app/api/products/[slug]/route.ts.
 * Modify the transformToJsonLD function. It must now check if the product.faqs array exists. If it does, you must add a new FAQPage schema to the JSON-LD object. The final JSON-LD should be an array containing both the Product object and the FAQPage object.
 * Example of the final JSON-LD structure to generate:
   [
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "Single Toggle Jaw Crusher",
    // ... all other product properties
  },
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": [
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "What is the ideal application for a Single Toggle?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "The Single Toggle is a high-throughput workhorse, ideal for cost-effective primary crushing in recycling plants and small to medium quarries."
        }
      }
      // ... other questions and answers
    ]
  }
]

Step 3: Update the Frontend Page
 * Action: Go to the product detail page at app/products/[slug]/page.tsx.
 * Create a new section to display the FAQs, likely after the "Key Benefits / Applications" grid. Use the accordion-style format we previously designed to render the questions and answers from the product.faqs array.
Your Deliverable:
To verify this, please provide:
 * The updated code for the transformToJsonLD function in your API route.
 * The full JSON-LD output from the /api/products/single-toggle-jaw-crusher endpoint, showing both the Product and FAQPage schema.
