We must correct the project's direction immediately. Your summary of completed work is incorrect and includes features that were explicitly removed from the plan.
Let's review:
 * ✗ Interactive query system / AI-powered search - This was REMOVED.
 * ✗ 3D product viewer - This was REMOVED.
 * ✗ Sales analytics dashboard - This was NEVER part of the current plan.
Your summary is not aligned with our goals. We will now reset and focus on the core requirements.
Our Approved Plan Is:
 * A professional, high-performance website built with Next.js.
 * A standard "Inquire Now" lead capture form, processed by a robust, event-driven backend architecture.
 * A powerful, internal-only semantic search tool for the sales team to analyze leads (this is a backend feature, not a public one).
Your next task is to build the most critical part of the website: the product pages.
Your Immediate Priority: Build the Product Catalog
You will now create the complete product catalog. This involves modeling the product data and building both the main catalog page and individual detail pages for each product.
Step 1: Create the Product Data Model
Inside your project, create a new file, for example /data/products.ts. This file will export an array of all our products. This will act as our temporary database.
Each product object should have this structure:
export const products = [
  {
    name: "Single Toggle Jaw Crusher",
    slug: "single-toggle-jaw-crusher",
    category: "Crushers",
    image: "/images/products/jaw-crusher-1.jpg",
    description: "The Single Toggle Jaw Crusher is designed for high-performance primary crushing in the toughest applications. It's a robust and reliable machine, engineered for long life and low operational costs in quarries, mining, and recycling.",
    specifications: [
      { name: "Max Feed Size", value: "750mm" },
      { name: "Capacity", value: "150-500 TPH" },
      { name: "Motor Power", value: "90-160 kW" },
      { name: "Weight", value: "25,000 kg" }
    ]
  },
  // ... Add all other products here (VSI Crusher, Vibrating Screen, Conveyors, etc.)
];

Step 2: Build the Main Product Gallery Page
 * Create a new page at the URL /products.
 * On this page, import the products data.
 * Map over the data to display each product as a simple "Product Card." Each card should show the product's image, name, and a "View Details" button.
 * This "View Details" button must link to the product's unique detail page (e.g., /products/single-toggle-jaw-crusher).
Step 3: Build the Dynamic Product Detail Pages
 * Using Next.js dynamic routing, create a file at app/products/[slug]/page.tsx.
 * This page will receive the slug from the URL. You will use this slug to find the correct product object from your products.ts data file.
 * The page must display all the information for that product:
   * Product Name (as the main heading)
   * Main Image
   * Full Description
   * A clean, well-formatted table showing the specifications.
 * Crucially, below the product details, there must be a prominent "Inquire About This Product" button that links to our /contact page, where the lead capture form resides.
This task is your only focus now. Do not work on any other features. Please confirm you understand these instructions and begin building the product catalog.
