From now on “Turnkey Solutions” should be your #1 solution everywhere, with the other four shifted down. Please implement these changes in one go—just follow these steps exactly, and don’t disturb any other existing logic:

1. **Data source**  
   - Edit `/data/solutions.json` so Turnkey is first:
     ```json
     [
       { "name": "Turnkey Solutions",      "slug": "turnkey-solutions" },
       { "name": "Mining & Aggregates",    "slug": "construction" },
       { "name": "Sand Washing & M-Sand",  "slug": "sand-washing-m-sand" },
       { "name": "Mobile & Modular Plants","slug": "mobile-modular-plants" },
       { "name": "C&D Recycling",         "slug": "c-and-d-recycling" }
     ]
     ```

2. **Turnkey page scaffold**  
   - Create or update `pages/solutions/turnkey-solutions.tsx` (or ensure your dynamic `[slug].tsx` handles “turnkey-solutions”).  
   - Copy the structure of the existing solutions detail pages—hero video, industry grid, FAQ—and replace titles/text with “Turnkey Solutions.”  
   - Place its media under:
     ```
     public/media/solutions/turnkey/intro.mp4
     public/media/solutions/turnkey/intro-poster.jpg
     ```

3. **Backend cleanup**  
   - Remove any legacy `/pages/api/solutions/*` or old JSON files so only `/data/solutions.json` remains.  
   - Confirm no stale imports reference the old order or endpoints.

4. **Media streaming**  
   - In your `<VideoHero>` components for home/about, set `controls={false}`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `playsInline`, and point `src` to the correct paths:  
     - Home: `/media/home/intro.mp4`  
     - About: `/media/about/overview.mp4`  
   - Ensure your server supports byte-range requests on `/public/media/**` so videos start instantly.

5. **Rebuild & test**  
   - Restart your dev server.  
   - On mobile, verify the solutions pills wrap into rows and “Turnkey Solutions” appears first.  
   - Navigate to `/solutions/turnkey-solutions` and confirm the new page matches the style of the other four.

Please implement exactly as above—do not remove or refactor any other components or data sources beyond what’s described. Thanks!```
