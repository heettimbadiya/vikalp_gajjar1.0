This is the final, comprehensive command to resolve all outstanding errors. You will clean the project, implement corrected data, and repair the navigation. Execute these steps in order.
Part 1: Clean the Build Cache
 * Action: You must first delete the Next.js build cache directory to ensure no old data can be used. Execute the following command in the terminal:
   rm -rf .next

Part 2: Recreate Authoritative Data File
 * Action: Now, delete and recreate the master data file with the final corrections.
 * 1. Delete the old file:
   rm -f src/data/products.ts

 * 2. Create a new file and paste the following complete and corrected code into it. This version includes fixes for the Vibrating Feeder and Screen TPH values.
   // src/data/products.ts

Part 3: Add Missing Navigation Link
 * Action: Edit the header component to add the "Conveyor Solutions" link.
 * 1. Open the file: src/components/header.tsx
 * 2. Find this line:
   <a data-replit-metadata="client/src/components/header.tsx:104:12" data-component-name="Link" href="/solutions" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-600 font-medium">Solutions</a>

 * 3. Add this new link directly after it:
   <a href="/solutions/conveyors" class="text-gray-700 hover:text-blue-600 font-medium">Conveyor Solutions</a>

Part 4: Rebuild and Restart the Application
 * Action: Now that the cache is clean and the source code is correct, perform a full rebuild and restart the server. Execute the following command in the terminal:
   npm run build && npm start

This comprehensive "clean and rebuild" process will resolve all outstanding issues and synchronize the website perfectly with your requirements.
