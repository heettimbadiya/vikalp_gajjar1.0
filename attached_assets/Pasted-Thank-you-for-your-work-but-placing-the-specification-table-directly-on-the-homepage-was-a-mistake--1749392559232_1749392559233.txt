Thank you for your work, but placing the specification table directly on the homepage was a mistake and not aligned with our plan.
Let's reset. The homepage is the most important page for attracting customers. Its purpose is to build trust, showcase our expertise, and guide visitors to the products they are interested in. Specification tables belong on the individual product detail pages, not the front page.
Your immediate and only priority is to delete the current homepage content and rebuild it according to this new, high-conversion blueprint.
Blueprint: The High-Conversion Industrial Homepage
You will structure the homepage (app/page.tsx) into the following sections, from top to bottom.
Section 1: The Hero Section
 * Goal: Immediately grab the visitor's attention and state our value proposition.
 * Content:
   * A powerful, benefit-oriented headline. Headline: "Engineered for Performance: India's Leading Manufacturer of Crushing & Conveying Solutions."
   * A short sub-headline: "Delivering robust, reliable equipment for quarries, mines, and infrastructure projects since [Year]."
   * Two clear Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons:
     * Primary Button: "Explore Our Products" (This should scroll down to the Featured Products section below).
     * Secondary Button: "Request a Consultation" (This should link to the /contact page).
Section 2: Trust Bar (Client Logos)
 * Goal: Build immediate credibility by showing who trusts us.
 * Content:
   * A simple heading: "Trusted by Industry Leaders Across India."
   * A horizontal row of 5-6 placeholder logos. You can use simple grey boxes or generic logo icons for now.
Section 3: Featured Products
 * Goal: Provide clear navigation to our most important products. This is the only place products should be listed on the homepage.
 * Content:
   * Headline: "Our Core Equipment Range"
   * Implementation:
     * Fetch the data from your /data/products.ts file.
     * Select 3 or 4 key products to feature (e.g., "Double Toggle Jaw Crusher," "VSI Crusher," "Mobile Crushing Plant").
     * Render each product as a professional "Product Card." Each card must contain:
       * The product's image.
       * The product's name.
       * A very short, one-sentence description.
       * A "View Details" button.
     * Crucially, the "View Details" button for each product must link to its future detail page. For example, the button for "Double Toggle Jaw Crusher" must link to /products/double-toggle-jaw-crusher.
Section 4: Key Differentiators (Why Choose Us?)
 * Goal: Quickly communicate our core strengths.
 * Content:
   * A grid of 3-4 items, each with a simple icon, a heading, and a short description.
   * Example Item 1:
     * Icon: A gear or wrench icon.
     * Heading: "Robust Engineering"
     * Text: "Designed and built in Ahmedabad for durability in the toughest Indian conditions."
   * Example Item 2:
     * Icon: A map pin or globe icon.
     * Heading: "Turnkey Plant Solutions"
     * Text: "From design to commissioning, we are your single-source partner for complete plant setups."
   * Example Item 3:
     * Icon: A headset or support icon.
     * Heading: "Dedicated Support"
     * Text: "Our expert technical team is available to ensure your operations run smoothly."
Section 5: Final Call to Action (CTA)
 * Goal: A final, clear prompt for the user to get in touch.
 * Content:
   * A full-width section with a contrasting background color.
   * Headline: "Have a Project in Mind?"
   * Text: "Let our experts help you select the right equipment to meet your production goals and budget."
   * Button: A large "Get Your Free Consultation" button that links to the /contact page.
Your Deliverable:
Please confirm you understand and then implement this new homepage design. Do not add any other elements. Once this is complete, the links in the "Featured Products" section will be broken, and our next step will be to create the individual product pages to make those links work.
