This is the final command to resolve all outstanding bugs. The project has a corrupt build cache, incorrect data, and a fragile UI component. You will fix all three issues by performing the following four steps in order.
Part 1: Clean the Build Cache
 * Action: To ensure no old pages or data are served, you must first completely delete the Next.js build cache. Execute the following command in the terminal:
   rm -rf .next

Part 2: Update the "CubiSand (VSI)" Data
 * Action: Go to the data file at /src/data/products.ts.
 * Find the product object where the slug is 'vsi-sand-washers'.
 * In that object, replace the entire spec_models array with the following final and correct data.
// Correct and final spec_models for VSI Sand Washers (CubiSand)
spec_models: [
  { "Model": "VT-VSI-1", "Feed Opening (mm)": 35, "Max Feed Size (mm)": 35, "Power (hp / kW)": "110-130 hp / 82-97 kW", "Throughput (TPH)": "60-100", "Rotor Speed (RPM)": "1800-2200" },
  { "Model": "VT-VSI-2", "Feed Opening (mm)": 40, "Max Feed Size (mm)": 40, "Power (hp / kW)": "160-190 hp / 120-142 kW", "Throughput (TPH)": "90-150", "Rotor Speed (RPM)": "1600-2000" },
  { "Model": "VT-VSI-3", "Feed Opening (mm)": 45, "Max Feed Size (mm)": 45, "Power (hp / kW)": "230-280 hp / 170-210 kW", "Throughput (TPH)": "160-250", "Rotor Speed (RPM)": "1500-1800" }
]

Part 3: Harden the Specification Table Component
 * Action: This is a critical bug fix. You must make the component that renders the specification table more robust.
 * 1. Go to the file: app/products/[slug]/page.tsx (or the specific component file for the table if it's separate).
 * 2. The Bug: The code is failing to render table cells (<td>) when the data is a complex string (like the Power specification).
 * 3. The Fix: Find where the table cell content is rendered. It will look something like {model[header]}. You must explicitly cast the value to a string to prevent any type errors. Change the code to be {String(model[header])}. This ensures any value (number or complex string) is handled correctly.
Part 4: Rebuild and Restart the Application
 * Action: Now that the cache is clean and all source code is correct, perform a full rebuild and restart the server. Execute the following command in the terminal:
   npm run build && npm start

This four-part command—Clean, Repair Data, Repair Code, Rebuild—will fix the underlying issues and correctly generate all product pages, including the one for the VSI.
