    q: "What is the purpose of vibrating feeders in crushing plants?",
    a: "Vibrating feeders regulate material flow to primary crushers, preventing surge loads and ensuring consistent feeding rates. They also perform pre-screening to remove undersized material and protect downstream equipment."
  },
  {
    q: "How do grizzly bars help in the feeding process?",
    a: "Grizzly bars built into the feeder deck scalp oversized rocks and debris before they reach the crusher. This prevents damage to the crusher and improves overall plant efficiency by removing material that doesn't need crushing."
  },
  {
    q: "What capacity ranges are available for vibrating feeders?",
    a: "Our vibrating feeders range from 50-100 TPH for smaller operations (VTF-1) up to 180-250 TPH for large-scale plants (VTF-3). Each model is designed to match specific crusher requirements and material characteristics."
  },
  {
    q: "What maintenance is required for vibrating feeders?",
    a: "Regular maintenance includes daily lubrication of bearings, weekly inspection of springs and mounting bolts, monthly check of motor alignment, and periodic replacement of grizzly bars based on wear patterns."
  },
  {
    q: "Can vibrating feeders handle wet or sticky materials?",
    a: "Yes, our feeders are designed with steep-angled decks and high-frequency vibration to handle moderately wet materials. For extremely sticky materials, we recommend heating options or specialized liner materials."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you control the feed rate of vibrating feeders?",
    a: "Feed rate is controlled through variable frequency drives (VFDs) that adjust vibration intensity, adjustable gates that control material flow opening, and timer controls for intermittent operation when needed."
  },
  {
    q: "What foundation requirements are needed for vibrating feeders?",
    a: "A properly sized concrete foundation with vibration isolation is essential. Foundation should be 2-3 times the feeder weight with rubber pads or spring isolators to prevent vibration transmission to surrounding structures."
  },
  {
    q: "What power requirements do vibrating feeders have?",
    a: "Power requirements range from 10 HP for smaller models (VTF-1) to 20 HP for larger units (VTF-3). All models use standard 3-phase electrical supply with motor protection and VFD control options."
