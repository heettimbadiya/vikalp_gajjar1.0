Excellent work creating the separate product pages. The foundational frontend structure is now in place.
Before we add more frontend features, it is critical that we integrate these new pages with the advanced backend architecture we designed. A user inquiring about a specific product is a highly valuable event, and our backend must handle it with intelligence.
Your next set of tasks will focus on bringing our backend to life.
Part 1: Enrich the Lead Capture Event
When a user submits an inquiry from a product page, the lead is far more valuable than a generic contact form submission. The LeadSubmittedV1 event must reflect this.
Action:
Modify the lead submission process. When the inquiry form is submitted from a product detail page (e.g., /products/double-toggle-jaw-crusher):
 * The frontend should include the product's name and slug in the payload sent to the /api/leads endpoint.
 * The /api/leads endpoint must add this productName and productSlug to the LeadSubmittedV1 event payload.
 * Update the database schema (shared/schema.ts) and the save-lead-consumer to store this associated product information with the lead.
Part 2: Build the Internal Sales Intelligence Dashboard
We will now build the "Internal Powerhouse" we designed earlier. This is where our sales team in Ahmedabad will use our AI backend to find high-quality leads.
Action:
 * Create a new, internal-only page at the URL /dashboard. (In a real application, this would be behind a login, but for now, the public URL is fine).
 * On this dashboard page, create a section titled "Sales Intelligence: Semantic Lead Search."
 * This section will contain a single search bar and a "Search" button.
Part 3: Implement the Internal Semantic Search Backend
This is the core of the AI trend integration.
Action:
 * Implement the GraphQL Endpoint: Create the internalSemanticSearchForLeads GraphQL query we designed.
 * Implement the Resolver: The resolver for this query must:
   * Take a natural language search query from the sales team (e.g., "inquiries about high capacity rock crushing").
   * Convert that query into a vector embedding.
   * Query our Vector Database to find Leads whose message or query_text is semantically similar to the search query.
   * Return a list of the matching leads, including the product they inquired about.
 * Connect to Frontend: The search bar on the /dashboard page should call this GraphQL query and display the results below it.
Part 4: Demonstrate the Event-Driven Architecture
To make the power of our EDA visible, we will add a simple real-time activity feed to the dashboard.
Action:
 * On the /dashboard page, add a new section called "Live Lead Activity."
 * This section will display a simple list of incoming leads.
 * Modify the notify-sales-team-consumer: in addition to sending an email, it should also publish a new, simple event like NewLeadForDashboard.
 * The "Live Lead Activity" component on the dashboard will listen for this event (you can simulate this with a simple polling mechanism for now) and display a new entry in real-time, such as: "New Inquiry from [Company Name] for [Product Name]!"
Your Deliverable:
 * Confirm that the lead capture process now includes product information.
 * Provide the URL for the new /dashboard page.
 * Provide the code for the internalSemanticSearchForLeads GraphQL resolver.
 * Explain how the "Live Lead Activity" feed is implemented.
