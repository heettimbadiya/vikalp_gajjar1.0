 Fix runtime errors & wire up “Industries We Serve” cards with background images

Description / Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Eliminate the HMR overlay error
	•	Track down and guard against any code that assumes t.nodeType exists on an undefined/null value.
	•	Wrap any direct DOM traversals in a if (node && node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE) { … } check or equivalent.
	•	Verify that Vite’s server.hmr.overlay remains enabled so you still catch other errors in dev.
	2.	Create a new images folder for solution backgrounds
	•	Mirror the existing /public/images/products/… structure with a /public/images/solutions/ directory.
	•	Agent should scaffold empty JPG/PNG placeholders named after each industry slug (mining.jpg, construction.jpg, washing.jpg, m-sand.jpg, mobile.jpg), so designers can drop in the final art later.
	3.	Wire up Industry cards to their detail anchors
	•	Update every .industry-card <a> so that:
	•	href="#industry-<slug>" instead of always pointing to /contact.
	•	The entire card (not just the button) is clickable and focusable (role="button", tabindex="0") with the correct aria-label.
	•	Ensure the <button class="industry-card__cta">Learn More</button> remains styled but no longer controls navigation—navigation should come from the wrapping <a>.
	4.	Swap out the “V” span logo for the small SVG/PNG
	•	In the header <Link href="/">…</Link>, replace the <div class="w-8 h-8 bg-blue-600 rounded"><span class="text-white">V</span></div> with an <img src="/images/logo-small.svg" alt="VTIS Industrial logo" width="32" height="32" />.
	•	Confirm alt text and dimensions match the design spec, and that this change doesn’t break the header’s flex centering or focus styles.
	5.	Prevent future backend/props errors
	•	Audit any API or prop drilling used on this page; add defensive defaults (e.g. data?.industries?.map(…)) so that missing data doesn’t throw in production builds.
	•	Add unit or smoke tests to cover the “Solutions” page rendering with an empty industry list and with a null response.
	6.	Verify UI/UX before merge
	•	Cards lazy-load their background images via CSS and show a subtle spinner or blurred placeholder until loaded.
	•	Hover, focus and active states still work (scale, shadow, ring).
	•	Keyboard nav: tab lands on each card, pressing ↵ jumps to the anchor section.
	•	Mobile: cards stack correctly at all breakpoints.
