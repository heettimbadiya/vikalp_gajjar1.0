Title: Update “Solutions” Page Sections & Images

Description / Acceptance Criteria:
	1.	Merge “Sand & Mineral Washing” and “Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)” into one section
	•	Combine their content under a single heading like “Sand Washing & M-Sand” (confirm exact copy with UX).
	•	Use one background image (e.g. /images/solutions/washing-m-sand.jpg) that you’ll drop into /public/images/solutions/—agent to scaffold placeholder now, replace when final art arrives.
	•	Consolidate their equipment lists and “Learn More” links into one card and one detail anchor (#industry-washing-m-sand).
	2.	Remove the “Mining Operations” section entirely
	•	Delete both the card and its hidden detail section from the Solutions page markup.
	•	Remove any associated anchor IDs, CSS, or JS related to mining.
	3.	Swap in the “Mobile Solutions” hero image from the Mobile Product page
	•	Locate the image used on /products/mobile-crushing-plant (e.g. /images/products/mobile-crushing-plant/hero.jpg).
	•	Use that same file as the background for the “Mobile & Modular Plants” card and detail section here.
	4.	Ensure every solution has its own standalone page and correct link
	•	For each remaining industry slug (construction, washing-m-sand, mobile), create or verify a /solutions/<slug>.tsx page.
	•	Update each card’s <a href> to point to /solutions/<slug> (instead of anchor links).
	•	On each detail page, include the appropriate Hero image, overview copy, equipment list, and a “Contact Us” CTA.
	5.	Update and optimize solution images
	•	In /public/images/solutions/, replace placeholders with the new designs you’ve uploaded (agent to pull latest files).
	•	Verify that each <section> and card uses the correct background-image URL and that images are sized/positioned per design.
	6.	QA & Accessibility Checks
	•	Confirm no console errors or broken HMR overlays in dev.
	•	Verify hover/focus/keyboard navigation on all cards and links.
	•	Test responsive layouts on mobile/tablet/desktop.
	•	Validate ARIA labels and alt text on any <img> elements.
