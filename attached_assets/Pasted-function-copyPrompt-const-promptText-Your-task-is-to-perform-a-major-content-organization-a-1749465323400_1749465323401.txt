This will involve creating a new 'hub-and-spoke' model for our service pages. This is a frontend structure and content task only. Do not change any backend code.

Please perform the following three steps precisely:

**1. Create a Main 'Services Hub' Page:**
   - Create a new, professionally designed landing page at the URL '/services'.
   - The headline should be "Comprehensive Support for the Entire Asset Lifecycle".
   - This page should have an introduction explaining our commitment to partnership and support.
   - Below the intro, create a section that acts as a summary for our five services. Display them in a clean, modern grid or card layout. Each service should have:
     - Its name (e.g., "Technical Consultation").
     - A brief, one-sentence summary.
     - A "Learn More" button that links to its own dedicated page (which you will create in the next step).

**2. Create Five Detailed 'Spoke' Pages:**
   - For each of the five services, create a new, dedicated page with a consistent, professional template. The URLs should be:
     - `/services/technical-consultation`
     - `/services/custom-engineering`
     - `/services/installation-support`
     - `/services/maintenance-services`
     - `/services/parts-and-components`
   - **For each of these five pages**, please generate detailed content that includes:
     - A clear headline (the name of the service).
     - An in-depth description of what the service involves.
     - A bulleted list of key features and benefits for the customer.
     - A strong call-to-action section at the bottom, prompting users to contact us for that specific service.

**3. Update the Main Navigation Bar (Website-Wide):**
   - Find the main navigation menu that appears on all pages of the website.
   - Replace the current, single "Services" link with a new dropdown menu.
   - The dropdown menu item should be titled "Services". When a user hovers over it, it should reveal links to all five of the new, detailed service pages you created in Step 2.

The final result should be a highly organized, professional, and easy-to-navigate section of our website dedicated to our service offerings.`;

    alert("Prompt copied to clipboard!");
  });
