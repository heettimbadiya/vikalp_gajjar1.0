UPDATE SEO & CONTENT — PRODUCTS & DETAILS

1. PRODUCTS LIST PAGE (/products)
• Add proper <title> and <meta name="description"> tags:
  – Title: “VTIS Industrial Equipment • Crushers, Screens, Washers & More”
  – Description: “Explore our full lineup of crushers, vibrating screens, sand washers, classifiers, feeders and conveyors. Engineered for heavy-duty performance in mining, aggregates and recycling.”
• Insert JSON-LD ProductList schema at page bottom:
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "ItemList",
    "itemListElement": [
      { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "url": "/products/single-toggle-jaw-crusher" },
      …all 11 products in their new order…
    ]
  }
• Above the grid, add an H1 “Our Equipment” and 2–3-sentence intro that highlights breadth, quality and global reach, e.g.:
  “VTIS Industrial brings 30+ years of engineering excellence to your site. Browse our range of primary and secondary crushers, screens, washers and material‐handling equipment—designed to maximize uptime, safety and ROI.”

2. INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT DETAIL PAGES (/products/[slug])
For each page:
• Update <title> to “<Product Name> | VTIS Industrial Equipment”
• Update <meta name="description"> to a concise, 155-character summary:
  “[Product Name] delivers [key benefit] for [application]. Explore specs, features, applications and get a quote today.”
• Ensure existing JSON-LD Product schema block includes accurate “name”, “description”, “image”, “brand”, “sku”, “offers” URL and “additionalProperty” entries.
• Where absent, insert JSON-LD BreadcrumbList schema:
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
    "itemListElement": [
      { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://vtis.replit.app/" },
      { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Products", "item": "https://vtis.replit.app/products" },
      { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "name": "<Product Name>", "item": "<current page URL>" }
    ]
  }

⚠️ Do NOT alter any existing layout, styling, scripts or non‐SEO content. Only inject/update meta tags, JSON-LD and the small intro copy above the product grid or detail sections.
