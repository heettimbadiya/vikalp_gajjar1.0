Branch off main → feature/homepage-redesign  
Keep build green (`pnpm run build && pnpm test`) after every major commit  

## 1. Data & API Enhancements  
1.1 Extend `/api/products?featured=true` to return all 10 “hero” products, each with:  
  - high-res AVIF/JPEG fallback URLs  
  - alt text, title, short “elevator pitch”  
  - category tag  
1.2 Add a `homepageOrder` field in your database so marketing can reorder without a deploy.  

## 2. Hero & Above-the-Fold  
2.1 Replace static banner with a **dynamic carousel** of 2–3 flagship machines, each:  
  - full-bleed background image (AVIF)  
  - bold H1 headline overlay in SF Pro Display, white text, subtle drop-shadow  
  - primary CTA (“Explore Equipment”) + secondary CTA (“Get Quote”)  
2.2 Preload the first hero image with `<link rel="preload" as="image">`.  

## 3. Featured-Products Grid  
3.1 Full-width white canvas—remove any dark overlays or half-cut containers.  
3.2 Responsive 5-column grid on desktop, 3 on tablet, 1–2 on mobile:  
```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-8 bg-white">
  {products.map(p => <ProductCard key={p.id} {...p} />)}
</div>

3.3 In each ProductCard:
	•	<picture> with AVIF & fallback
	•	fixed aspect-ratio container (4:3), object-cover, no cropping of important features
	•	overlay category badge in upper corner
	•	title in SF Pro Text, 1–2 line clamp
	•	“View Details” button with gentle hover scale and shadow

4. Image & Performance Optimizations

4.1 Convert all product thumbnails to AVIF + JPEG fallback; generate on build.
4.2 Lazy-load offscreen images (loading="lazy").
4.3 Use Next-gen responsive srcset breakpoints for mobile/desktop.

5. WWDC26-Inspired Micro-Interactions
	•	Card Hover: transition-transform duration-200 ease-out hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg
	•	Smooth Scroll: anchor links scroll softly (scroll-behavior: smooth)
	•	Subtle Glassmorphism on sticky header: backdrop-blur-sm bg-white/70

6. Accessibility & SEO

6.1 Ensure every <img> has a meaningful alt.
6.2 Add structured-data for the featured array on the homepage root.
6.3 Include ARIA roles on carousels and grids.

7. Verification & QA
	•	✅ All 10 products render crisply on all screen sizes
	•	✅ No half-cut images or dark backgrounds
	•	✅ Lighthouse score L > 90 P > 90 A > 90
	•	✅ Hero preloads correctly and carousels animate smoothly
