The dynamic navigation menu is working well. However, the underlying product data needs to be corrected and updated for technical accuracy and completeness.

Your task is to update and correct the product database. Perform the following four actions precisely:

**1. Correct Product Classification:**
   - The product 'VSI Sand Washers (CubiSand)' is miscategorized. A VSI (Vertical Shaft Impactor) is a tertiary stage crusher, not a washer.
   - **Action:** Move 'VSI (CubiSand)' from the "Sand Processing" category to the "Crushing Equipment" category. Update its description to reflect that it is a machine for producing high-quality cubical sand through impact crushing.

**2. Refine Product Granularity (Jaw Crushers):**
   - The current 'Jaw Crushers (VTIS Series)' entry is too general. We need to specify the two main types.
   - **Action:** Replace the single 'Jaw Crushers (VTIS Series)' product with two new, distinct products:
     - **a) Single Toggle Jaw Crusher**
     - **b) Double Toggle Jaw Crusher**
   - For each, generate appropriate marketing copy and technical specifications. Highlight their key differences: e.g., Single Toggle for general quarrying and Double Toggle for extremely hard and abrasive materials. Place both under the "Crushing Equipment" category.

**3. Add Missing Product Lines:**
   - Two major product categories are missing from the catalog.
   - **Action:** Add the following two new product lines. For each, create a top-level category and generate professional marketing content, benefits, and typical applications similar to the other products:
     - **a) Conveyor Systems:** Describe as essential for material transport in processing plants, including details on belt width, length, and capacity.
     - **b) Turnkey Solutions:** Describe this as our comprehensive service for designing, fabricating, installing, and commissioning complete crushing and screening plants from start to finish.

**4. Verify Automatic Menu Update:**
   - After performing all database updates, confirm that the main navigation menu automatically reflects these changes without any manual coding. The menu should now show the corrected categories and the new product lines.

Please proceed with these data corrections
