We need to correct two critical issues with the website's structure and content presentation. Your entire focus now is on fixing the site's navigation and simplifying the product catalog.
Part 1: The Global Layout Solution (Fixing Missing Headers & Footers)
The reason headers and footers are missing on some pages is the lack of a global site layout. We will implement this now, which is the standard and professional way to build a website.
Your Task:
 * Create a Global Layout: Create (or verify that you have) a root layout file at app/layout.tsx.
 * Move Global Components: This layout.tsx file will act as a master template for every page. Move your <Header> and <footer> components into this file, so they wrap around the page content.
 * Apply to All Pages: Ensure that all existing pages (/, /products, /about, /contact, and the dynamic product pages) are correctly rendered as children of this new global layout.
This single architectural change will ensure that every page on our website has a consistent header and footer, instantly fixing the broken navigation experience.
Part 2: The Product Catalog Correction (Fixing the 50+ Products Issue)
The current product catalog is confusing. It must not show every single model. It should only show our main product categories.
Your Task:
 * Go to the Main Product Catalog Page (/products).
 * Correct the Logic: The code for this page must be refactored. It should process our products.ts data file and display only 8 product cards in the gridâ€”one for each main product line (Jaw Crushers, HSI Impactors, Inclined Vibrating Screens, etc.).
 * Ensure Correct Linking: The "View Details" button on each of these 8 cards must link to the correct detail page (e.g., the "Jaw Crushers" card links to /products/jaw-crushers).
To be perfectly clear: The detailed table of individual models (like 'VTIS-4220', 'VTIS-6030', etc.) should only be visible on the final product detail page, not on this main /products catalog page.
Your Deliverable:
This is a critical refactoring task. Please confirm when you have completed these fixes by verifying the following:
 * A global layout is now in place, and pages like /contact and /about now have the standard website header and footer.
 * The main /products catalog page now correctly displays only 8 product cards.
 * Clicking one of those cards (e.g., 'Inclined Vibrating Screens') takes you to the single detail page where the table of all its individual models is displayed.
