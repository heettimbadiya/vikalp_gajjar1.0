🔄 Revision: Replace “cone-crushers” & supply complete FAQ copy for all 10 actual products

Below is the drop-in replacement for §2 · Per-Product FAQ Sets in the earlier agent brief.
Changes:
	1.	Removed cone-crushers (not a sellable SKU).
	2.	Added conveyor-systems so the count still equals 10.
	3.	Supplied all 30 Q & A lines ready for copy-paste into the /content/faq/*.faq.ts files.

FAQ COPY (F1 – F30)
(one line = one Q, one line = its A; keep the order for import)

F1 Q: What materials can the single-toggle jaw crusher handle? 
   A: Up to 300 MPa rock—basalt, granite, even reinforced concrete—thanks to its deep-V chamber and 110 kW flywheel.

F2 Q: How quickly can jaw plates be changed? 
   A: Two techs with an impact gun swap plates in under 45 minutes using the slide-out seat and captive wedges.

F3 Q: Is remote condition monitoring supported? 
   A: Yes—an optional IoT node streams bearing temp, stroke counts and kWh/t via MQTT or OPC-UA.

F4 Q: Why choose a double-toggle jaw crusher? 
   A: The longer stroke and double toggle deliver higher nip angles—ideal for 400 MPa iron-ore or abrasive quartzite.

F5 Q: What is the expected pitman life? 
   A: Over 20 000 h thanks to alloy-steel forgings and full stress-relief heat treatment.

F6 Q: Does it ship container-ready? 
   A: Breaks into three ISO-20′ modules, no oversize permits required worldwide.

F7 Q: What makes the HSI rotor unique?  
   A: The 4-bar, 600 mm deep rotor accepts 700 mm feed and auto-balances at 1 500 rpm for lower vibration.

F8 Q: Can I swap blow-bars in the field?  
   A: Yes—one person, manual hoist; reversible bars mean double wear life.

F9 Q: How does the hydraulic curtain protect against tramp iron?  
   A: Pressure spikes trigger a 40 ms relief that clears steel without stopping the drive.

F10 Q: What slope angle are the inclined screens set to?  
    A: Factory-set at 18°, adjustable ±3° to tune retention time.

F11 Q: Are decks quick-release?  
    A: Yes—snap-lock rail system lets crews trade wire cloth for urethane panels in < 30 min per deck.

F12 Q: What drives the vibrator mechanism?  
    A: Dual self-sync exciters with SKF bearings and splash lubrication—50 000 h L10 life.

F13 Q: Why use a grizzly screen before primary crushing?  
    A: It scalps out 0-100 mm fines, boosting crusher throughput by ≈ 15 %.

F14 Q: Is the bar spacing customizable?  
    A: Every unit ships with bolt-on rails in 25, 50 or 75 mm increments.

F15 Q: How is the pan protected from impact?  
    A: Replaceable 400 HB liners + rubber cushions under the exciter beam.

F16 Q: What sand cut-size can the bucket classifier achieve?  
    A: Adjustable weir lets you split at D₅₀ 150-300 µm.

F17 Q: Is the bucket wheel reversible?  
    A: Yes—extending bearing life and evening out wear.

F18 Q: Water requirement per tonne?  
    A: ~0.25 m³ / t with our high-efficiency sump pump loop.

F19 Q: How fine can the hydrocyclone classifier separate?  
    A: Down to 75 µm at 2.6 SG using our 150 mm apex kit.

F20 Q: Are the liners replaceable?  
    A: Snap-fit polyurethane liners change out in 10 minutes—no adhesive.

F21 Q: How do I control underflow density?  
    A: Pneumatic pinch-valve with PID loop tied to a density meter.

F22 Q: What’s unique about the CubiSand rotor?  
    A: 5-port enclosed rotor yields < 7 % minus-75 µm while improving cube shape index by 20 %.

F23 Q: Power draw on 60 Hz grid?  
    A: 250 kW @ 1 800 rpm, soft-starter ready.

F24 Q: Does it accept wet feed?  
    A: Up to 12 % moisture; cascade ports prevent build-up.

F25 Q: How fast can the mobile plant deploy?  
    A: Track self-levels in under 12 minutes; no cranes needed.

F26 Q: Is the genset Stage V compliant?  
    A: Yes—diesel-electric hybrid meets EU Stage V & US Tier 4F.

F27 Q: Can I run it from grid power on site?  
    A: Plug-in 400 V / 125 A receptacle for silent, zero-emission mode.

F28 Q: What belt widths are supported?  
    A: 500 to 1 200 mm with modular truss spans up to 60 m.

F29 Q: How is belt tracking maintained?  
    A: Auto-align trainers + LIDAR edge detection feeding the PLC.

F30 Q: Can I get stainless rollers for corrosive plants?  
    A: 304 SS or rubber-coated rollers are a factory option, lead-time 2 weeks.
