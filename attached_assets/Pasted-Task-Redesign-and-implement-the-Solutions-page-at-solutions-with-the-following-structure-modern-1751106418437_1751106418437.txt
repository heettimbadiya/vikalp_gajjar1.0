Task:
Redesign and implement the “Solutions” page at /solutions with the following structure, modern look-and-feel (including light animation effects), and SEO-optimized copy. Do not leave sections sparsely populated—each section needs 2–3 rich sentences to guide and persuade a potential customer.

⸻

1. Page Header & Hero
	•	Remove the existing “Industry Solutions” gradient hero.
	•	Add a clean hero bar at top with:
	•	Headline: “Tailored Equipment & Turnkey Systems for Every Application”
	•	Sub-headline: “Engineering excellence across mining, aggregates, washing, sand making, and mobile plants.”
	•	Primary CTA button: “Get a Custom Quote” (sticky at top on scroll).
	•	Hero background: subtle SVG wave or parallax image of our equipment in action.
	•	Light fade-in animation on text and CTA on page load.

2. Page Intro Copy

Add two short paragraphs (3–4 sentences each) that:
	•	Introduce VTIS’s 30+ years of industry leadership
	•	Emphasize turnkey offering (from plant design through commissioning)
	•	Highlight global installations and 150+ expert team members
	•	Include keywords: “mining crushing solutions,” “precision screening,” “modular crushing plants,” “sand shaping VSI.”

3. “Industries We Serve” Section
	•	Title: “Industries We Serve”
	•	Intro line (1 sentence): “Solutions engineered for your toughest processing challenges.”
	•	Full four-column table:

Industry	Key Pain Point	VTIS Solution Pillar	Products Used
Mining Operations	Hard-rock abrasion & uptime	High-Capacity Crushing	Single-Toggle Jaw, Double-Toggle Jaw
Construction & Aggregates	Consistent sizing & fines control	Precision Screening	Inclined Vibrating Screens, HSI Impactors
Sand & Mineral Washing	Ultra-fine removal & reclaim	Classification & Washing	Bucket Sand Classifier, Hydrocyclone Classifier
Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)	Cubical shape & low flakiness	VSI Shaping	VSI (CubiSand) Sand Maker
Mobile & Modular Plants	On-site mobility & quick setup	Plug-and-Play Systems	Mobile Crushing Plant, Grizzly & Pan Feeders


	•	Table styling: responsive grid on mobile, hover row-highlight effect, fade-in rows as user scrolls.

4. “What Our Clients Say” Slider
	•	Title: “Trusted by Industry Leaders”
	•	Add 3–4 testimonial cards (quote + name + company) in a looping carousel with slide-in animation.

5. “Why VTIS” Feature Pillars
	•	Grid of 3 icons + headings + 2–3 sentence blurbs:
	1.	Complete Plant Design — “From feasibility studies to layout drawings, we design turnkey crushing & screening plants optimized for your site.”
	2.	Process Optimization — “Our simulations and wear-testing minimize downtime and maximize throughput across every stage.”
	3.	Lifecycle Support — “Installation, commissioning, maintenance, and genuine spares—support that keeps you running.”

6. Secondary CTA Banner
	•	Background: subtle animation (e.g. moving particles)
	•	Text: “Ready to discuss your custom solution?”
	•	Button: “Schedule Your Consultation”

7. SEO & Accessibility
	•	Headings use proper <h1>–<h3> hierarchy.
	•	Add a hidden <script type="application/ld+json"> for the FAQPage schema (once FAQs are integrated).
	•	Write alt-text for all images.
	•	Include 2–3 internal links: link to /products, /contact, and one key solution subpage.
