## Landing Page Redesign  

### 1. Header  
- Logo aligned left; clickable, links to “/”  
- Search input + primary nav links (Home, Products, Solutions, About, Contact) aligned right  
- Sticky on scroll with subtle backdrop-blur (glassmorphism)  

### 2. Industries Strip  
- Full-width horizontal bar directly beneath header  
- White background, single row of industry names only (e.g. “Mining • Quarrying • Recycling • Infrastructure”)  
- Center-aligned text, ample letter-spacing  

### 3. Hero Visual  
- Full-bleed banner image or video with gentle Ken Burns effect (slow pan/zoom)  
- No text or CTAs overlaid  

### 4. Tagline Block  
- Below hero, center-aligned marketing tagline (H2) in large SF Pro Display  
- Primary CTA button (“Explore Our Equipment”) beneath, large, rounded, consistent shadow  

### 5. About Preview  
- Two-column section: left side image with soft drop-shadow, right side short 2–3 sentence description  
- Beneath text, secondary CTA button (“Learn About Us”)  
- Entire block links to “/about”  

### 6. Featured Products Carousel  
- Horizontal scroll container showing all 10 products as cards  
- Each card: fixed 4:3 ratio image, product title below  
- Entire card clickable to product page  
- Snap-to-center scroll behavior, arrows at edges on desktop  

### 7. Contact Teaser  
- Full-width band with background color (light blue)  
- Short prompt (“Ready to talk? Contact our experts.”) + CTA button (“Get in Touch”)  

### 8. Footer  
- Standard site links and contact info on white background  
- Social icons, privacy/terms links  

## General UI/UX Notes  
- All backgrounds pure white (#fff) to avoid visual “mess”  
- Generous padding & margin for clean whitespace  
- Consistent type scale: H1 → H4 using SF Pro family  
- Button interactions: `hover:scale-105; shadow-lg`  
- Mobile-first responsive: stack sections, collapse nav into hamburger  

Please implement these changes to give the homepage a streamlined, modern interface that showcases your full product lineup clearly and drives conversion.```
