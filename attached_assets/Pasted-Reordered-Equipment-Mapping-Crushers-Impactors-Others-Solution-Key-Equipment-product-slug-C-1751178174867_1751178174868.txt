Agent Prompt & Backend Architecture Suggestion

Prompt for the Replit Agent

Objective:
Redesign each Solution page to a mobile-first, clean layout that:
	1.	Renders a Hero Section with headline, 2–3-sentence intro, and “Get a Custom Solution” CTA (links to /contact).
	2.	Presents an Equipment Grid in the order Crushers → Impactors → Other Equipment, with each card showing:
	•	Thumbnail (from /images/products/{slug}.jpg)
	•	Product name
	•	Link to its product page at /products/{slug}
	3.	Includes an Applications Showcase of three icon + one-line text cards.
	4.	Ends with a full-width Closing CTA: “Ready to optimize your [Solution Name] process?” with buttons “Contact Us” (/contact) and “View All Equipment” (/products).
	5.	Ensures accessibility: alt text on all images, visible focus states, and responsive breakpoints at 640px and 1024px.

Equipment Mapping (Crushers → Impactors → Others):
	•	Construction & Aggregates: single-toggle-jaw-crusher, double-toggle-jaw-crusher, hsi-impactors, inclined-vibrating-screens
	•	Sand Washing & M-Sand: vsi-cubisand-sand-maker, bucket-sand-classifiers, hydrocyclone-sand-classifiers
	•	Mobile & Modular Plants: single-toggle-jaw-crusher, double-toggle-jaw-crusher, hsi-impactors, inclined-vibrating-screens, mobile-crushing-plant, grizzly-feeders
	•	C&D Recycling: single-toggle-jaw-crusher, double-toggle-jaw-crusher, hsi-impactors, inclined-vibrating-screens, grizzly-feeders, conveyor-systems, trommel-screens, magnetic-separators

Clean Backend Architecture (Node.js / Replit-first)
	•	Routes & Controllers
	•	GET /solutions/:slug → solutionsController.show(slug)
	•	GET /products/:slug → productsController.show(slug)
	•	Data Layer
	•	JSON or small MongoDB collection for “solutions” and “products” documents including slug, name, thumbnail, description, and equipmentSlugs[].
	•	Services
	•	solutionService.getSolutionWithProducts(slug)
	•	Fetch solution by slug
	•	Lookup equipmentSlugs → product records for grid
	•	Views / React Components
	•	<SolutionPage solution={...} products={...} />
	•	<EquipmentGrid items={products} order={['crushers','impactors','others']} />
	•	<Hero title intro ctaLink/>, <ApplicationsList apps={…}/>, <FooterCTA/>
	•	Assets
	•	Store product images under /public/images/products/{slug}.jpg
	•	Solution banners under /public/images/solutions/{slug}.jpg
	•	Mobile-First CSS
	•	Use Tailwind with sm:, md: breakpoints
	•	Layout defaults stack vertically; at sm switches to grid, at md expands further

Ensure everything is tested on small (375px), medium (640px), and desktop (1024px+) widths before deploying.
