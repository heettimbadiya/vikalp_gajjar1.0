Branch off main → feature/homepage-mobile-first  
Keep build green (`pnpm run build && pnpm test`) after every major commit  

## 1. Mobile-First Foundation  
- Design all layout blocks for small screens first; then scale up to tablet/desktop  
- Use responsive CSS utilities (e.g. Tailwind’s `sm:`, `md:`) to adjust layouts  

## 2. Header + Industries Strip  
- Header: logo left, hamburger menu & search icon right on mobile; expand to full nav on tablet+  
- Directly beneath header, full-width strip with **background:#F3F4F6 (light gray)**  
- Center-aligned industry links **Mining Operations**, **Construction & Aggregates**, **Recycling & Waste Management** separated by dots  
- Tappable items navigate to `/solutions/mining`, `/solutions/aggregates`, `/solutions/recycling`  

## 3. Hero Visual  
- Full-screen mobile-optimized image/video with gentle Ken Burns effect  
- No overlaid text or buttons; allow the image to breathe  

## 4. Tagline Block + Lead-In Copy  
- On mobile: center-aligned H2 + paragraph + single CTA button  
- Example copy:  
  > **“Power your plant with VTIS Industrial Equipment.”**  
  > Small text: “Discover robust, energy-efficient crushers and screens engineered for your toughest projects.”  
  > Button: “Explore Products”  
- Background: white  

## 5. About Preview → Modern Split Card  
- Use **stacked cards** on mobile: image on top, content below  
- Wrap each card in a subtle **rounded container** with card-style drop shadow  
- Content card: left edge accent bar in brand blue; headline + 40-word teaser; button “Our Story”  
- On tablet/desktop: two-column grid with overlap (image container shifts slightly over content container)  

## 6. Featured Products Carousel → Fluid Snap + Autoplay  
- Horizontal carousel with **autoplay (5s interval)** but pausable on touch/hover  
- Snap scroll behavior via `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`  
- Show 1.5 cards on mobile (peek next item), 3 cards on desktop  
- Add next/prev arrows that fade in on hover; pagination dots below carousel  

## 7. Contact Teaser  
- Background: **#E0F2FF (light blue)**  
- Mobile: stacked text + button; desktop: two columns  
- Copy: “Have a project in mind? Our experts are here to help.” + “Get in Touch”  

## 8. Footer  
- Simplified mobile layout: accordion for sections; expand on tap  
- White background, clear text  

### Deliverables  
- Fully mobile-first React components with Tailwind classes  
- Carousel uses accessible `aria-live` region for autoplay announcements  
- All new sections covered by unit/integration tests
