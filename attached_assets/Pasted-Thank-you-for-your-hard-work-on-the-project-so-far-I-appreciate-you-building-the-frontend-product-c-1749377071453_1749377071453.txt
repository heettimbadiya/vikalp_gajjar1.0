Thank you for your hard work on the project so far. I appreciate you building the frontend product catalog. However, I noticed that the interactive input is still visible, and I need to verify that the backend architecture is set up correctly. Let's work together to make sure everything is aligned with the final plan.

To keep things organized, I've created a Backend Implementation Audit checklist. Please provide the code snippets requested below. If a particular piece of code isn't implemented yet, simply state that it's not yet implemented.

Backend Audit Checklist:

1.  The Event-Driven Lead Pipeline Verification:

    A)  The GraphQL Mutation: Please provide the code for the GraphQL resolver that handles the form submission. This code should only validate the data and publish an event to the event bus. It should not directly save to the database or send an email.

    B)  The "Save Lead" Consumer: Please provide the code for the separate serverless function that listens for the LeadSubmittedV1 event and saves the lead's data to the PostgreSQL database.

    C)  The "Notify Sales" Consumer: Please provide the code for the second, separate serverless function that also listens for the LeadSubmittedV1 event and sends an email notification to our sales team.

2.  The Internal Semantic Search Verification:

    A)  The GraphQL Schema: Please provide the schema definition for the internalSemanticSearchForLeads query.

    B)  The Resolver Function: Please provide the code for the resolver that executes this search. Please show the part of the code that connects to the Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate) and performs the semantic query.

3.  The Database Schema Verification:

    Please provide the SQL CREATE TABLE statement or the Prisma schema for the Leads table in your PostgreSQL database.

Mandatory Frontend Cleanup:

Before we proceed, please remove all traces of the original "Interactive Query System" and the "3D Viewer" from the codebase. This includes any components in the components folder, any references on the homepage (app/page.tsx), and any links in the navigation header. The final application should have no reference to these features.

Your Deliverable:

Please provide the code snippets requested in the audit checklist and confirm that you have completed the mandatory frontend cleanup. I am here to help if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing the code and working together to get this project finalized.
