  const promptText = `This is a final strategic change to the website's structure. We will be consolidating all service information onto a single page. This task involves restructuring content and navigation; do not change any backend code.

Please perform the following three steps precisely:

**1. Consolidate All Service Content onto One Page:**
   - Go to the main '/services' hub page.
   - Below the existing introduction ("Comprehensive Support for the Entire Asset Lifecycle"), append the **full, detailed content** from each of the five individual service pages.
   - The final page should have the following order:
     1. Main introduction.
     2. A section for 'Technical Consultation' (with its full description, features, etc.).
     3. A section for 'Custom Engineering' (with its full description, features, etc.).
     4. A section for 'Installation Support' (with its full description, features, etc.).
     5. A section for 'Maintenance Services' (with its full description, features, etc.).
     6. A section for 'Parts & Components' (with its full description, features, etc.).
   - Ensure there is clear visual separation (e.g., a headline and a horizontal line) between each service's section on this single page.

**2. Delete the Individual Service Pages:**
   - After you have copied all the content to the main '/services' page, please delete the five individual 'spoke' pages:
     - `/services/technical-consultation`
     - `/services/custom-engineering`
     - `/services/installation-support`
     - `/services/maintenance-services`
     - `/services/parts-and-components`

**3. Simplify the Main Navigation Menu:**
   - Across the entire website, find the main navigation bar.
   - Remove the "Services & Support" **dropdown menu**.
   - In its place, add a single, non-dropdown link titled **"Services"**.
   - This "Services" link should navigate directly to the one, consolidated '/services' page.

The final result should be a website with a single, comprehensive page for all services and a simplified main navigation menu that links directly to it.`;
