    q: "What is the difference between single and double screw sand washers?",
    a: "Single screw washers have one spiral classifier, ideal for smaller capacity operations (30-100 TPH). Double screw washers feature two parallel spirals, providing higher capacity (100-180+ TPH) and better washing efficiency for larger operations."
  },
  {
    q: "How much water is required for screw sand washing operations?",
    a: "Screw sand washers are designed for low water consumption, typically requiring 2-4 cubic meters of water per ton of sand processed. The spiral design allows for effective water recycling and minimal waste."
  },
  {
    q: "What particle sizes can be effectively washed with screw sand washers?",
    a: "Screw sand washers are most effective for particles ranging from 0.15mm to 5mm. They excel at removing clay, silt, and other fine impurities from sand and fine aggregates while minimizing loss of valuable material."
  },
  {
    q: "What maintenance is required for screw sand washers?",
    a: "Regular maintenance includes daily lubrication of bearings, weekly inspection of wear parts, monthly gearbox oil level checks, and periodic replacement of spiral flights and discharge chutes based on wear patterns."
  },
  {
    q: "Can screw sand washers handle recycled concrete aggregates?",
    a: "Yes, screw sand washers are excellent for processing recycled concrete aggregates. They effectively remove cement paste, mortar, and other contaminants while recovering clean, reusable sand fractions."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the typical power consumption of screw sand washers?",
    a: "Power consumption varies by model size: SW-6S requires 11kW, SW-9S needs 15kW, and the double screw SW-9D consumes 22kW. These units are designed for energy efficiency while maintaining high washing performance."
  },
  {
    q: "How do you control the moisture content of washed sand?",
    a: "Moisture content is controlled through spiral speed adjustment, discharge weir height settings, and residence time. Properly configured screw washers can achieve final moisture content of 8-12% in washed sand."
  },
  {
    q: "What foundation requirements are needed for screw sand washers?",
    a: "A reinforced concrete foundation with proper drainage is required. Foundation depth should be at least 1.5 meters with vibration isolation pads. Proper slope (2-3%) toward discharge end ensures optimal performance."
