Excellent. The website structure is now defined by our sitemap. Your next task is to build the individual "Solutions by Industry" pages.
You will create a dynamic page template that showcases our expertise and recommends the right equipment for specific industries.
Step 1: Create the Dynamic Page Template
 * Action: Create a new dynamic route at app/solutions/[industry]/page.tsx.
 * This page will take an industry slug from the URL (e.g., "mining") and display content tailored to that industry.
Step 2: Design the Page Content Blueprint
The page template must contain the following sections, populated with relevant content:
 * Hero Section:
   * A large title, e.g., "Solutions for the Mining Industry."
   * A short, descriptive paragraph explaining the unique challenges of that industry. For "Mining," this would be about handling hard, abrasive materials and the need for high uptime.
 * Recommended Equipment Section:
   * A headline like "Recommended Equipment for Mining Operations."
   * Logic: From our data/products.ts file, you will feature a grid of the products most relevant to that industry.
     * For a "Mining" page, you should feature: Jaw Crushers, Grizzly Screens, and HSI Impactors.
     * For a "Construction & Aggregates" page, you should feature: Inclined Vibrating Screens, VSI Sand Washers, and Conveyors.
   * Each product shown must be a "Product Card" with its image, name, and a button linking to its full detail page. This creates valuable internal links for SEO.
 * Our Expertise Section:
   * A content block with a title like "Why Choose Us for Your Mining Needs?"
   * Include a paragraph explaining our company's experience in this sector, highlighting our robust engineering and support from our base in Ahmedabad.
 * Call to Action (CTA):
   * A prominent button at the bottom of the page with text like "Contact Our Mining Solutions Expert" that links to the main /contact page.
Step 3: Build and Link the Initial Pages
Action:
 * Using the template you just built, create the content for and ensure these two pages are live:
   * /solutions/mining
   * /solutions/construction-aggregates
 * Update the main /solutions landing page so that its cards for "Mining" and "Construction & Aggregates" now correctly link to these new detail pages.
Your Deliverable:
Please confirm when you have created the dynamic page template and the two initial industry solution pages. I will then review /solutions/mining to ensure it is implemented correctly.
