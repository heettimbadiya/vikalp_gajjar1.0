Here’s a single, self-contained brief you can drop into your QA or dev-ops workflow (or send to your agent) to systematically audit before you go live:

Audit Brief: Solutions/Industries Page UI & UX

Goal: Verify that the revamped Solutions/Industries page meets all design, accessibility, performance, and quality standards before hosting.

	1.	Responsiveness & Layout
	•	Inspect on mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints.
	•	Rotate devices (portrait ↔ landscape) and confirm nothing shifts or overlaps.
	•	Check grid collapse and stacking of industry cards.
	2.	Accessibility
	•	Tab through all interactive elements (cards, “Learn More,” contact links) — focus states must be obvious.
	•	Verify each industry card has an aria-label (e.g. “Learn more about Mining Operations”).
	•	Ensure color-contrast ratios ≥4.5:1 for text over images/backgrounds.
	3.	Images & Assets
	•	Industry cards: background images set up for lazy-loading.
	•	Placeholder or “Coming Soon” state if image fails to load.
	•	Check that uploaded images maintain correct aspect ratio and resolution.
	4.	Performance
	•	Run Lighthouse audit: LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, TBT minimal.
	•	Confirm CSS/JS bundles are minified; defer non-critical scripts.
	•	Validate HTTP caching headers for static assets.
	5.	Cross-Browser QA
	•	Spot-test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest and at least one older major version).
	•	Validate graceful degradation in legacy or mobile browsers.
	6.	Interactions & Feedback
	•	Hover/focus states on desktop: slight scale/shadow.
	•	Touch targets ≥44×44px on mobile.
	•	If any panels fetch data dynamically, ensure skeleton loaders/spinners are in place.
	7.	Content & Links
	•	Headings follow H1→H2→H3 hierarchy.
	•	“Learn More” buttons on each card point to the correct anchor or /contact-us.
	•	No 404s or broken links.
	8.	SEO & Deep Linking
	•	Meta tags (title, description, OG & Twitter) present and accurate.
	•	Each industry card’s slug matches its anchor id for direct links.
	9.	Analytics & Tracking
	•	Track click events on cards and CTAs with your analytics tool.
	•	Verify page-view tags fire on both main page and any sub-sections.
	10.	Security & Compliance

	•	No console errors or CSP violations.
	•	Any third-party scripts load only after user consent if required.
